                    <h1>If we can't design autonomous robots, maybe they can design themselves</h1>

                    <p>Elon Musk’s recent announcement of an upcoming Tesla Bot — complete with a human form,
                        “human-level hands” and a
                        characteristically optimistic delivery date — has garnered a healthy serving of criticism for
                        good reason.</p>
                    <p>Among other capabilities, Musk says, the robot will eventually be capable of running errands such
                        as going to the
                        grocery store alone. Boston Dynamics, which has developed the most advanced humanoid robot ever
                        created, has spent more
                        than a decade working on its Atlas platform. While progress has been impressive, with Atlas
                        running, jumping and even
                        dancing in front of tens of millions of YouTube viewers, the company is quick to acknowledge
                        that the robot is a long
                        way from performing complex tasks autonomously.</p>
                    <blockquote>"Creating a robot that can operate on its own would likely require several hundred
                        “generations” of evolution in which robots perform mutations and combine the most desirable
                        traits from two different parents." -Gideon Kimbrell
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>They concluded that “these examples of experimental evolution with robots verify the power of
                        evolution by mutation,
                        recombination and natural selection. In all cases, robots initially exhibited completely
                        uncoordinated behaviour because
                        their genomes had random values.”</p>
                    <p>In sum, the study concluded that “a few hundreds of generations of random mutations and selective
                        reproduction were
                        sufficient to promote the evolution of efficient behaviours in a wide range of environmental
                        conditions.”</p>
                    <h2>Progress versus perfection</h2>
                    <p>I think there’s a chance Musk could actually leapfrog the competition in the field of robotics,
                        but he’ll need some help
                        from the robots themselves. According to many experts in the evolutionary computation space,
                        robots capable of
                        complicated tasks that require constant feedback or learning loops are simply too complex for
                        humans to design directly
                        on their own. Instead, the future of robotic development and design could be a product of
                        “evolution” that has the
                        robots selecting which features are most useful for a specific outcome.</p>
                    <p>For the first time in modern history, we have all the necessary building blocks to facilitate
                        evolutionary robotics:
                        rapid prototyping and physical reproduction using 3D printing, neural networks for learning and
                        training, improved
                        battery life and cheaper materials and much more.</p>
